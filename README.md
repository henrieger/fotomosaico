# Photomosaic

This project was made as an exercise for the course CI1002 - Programação 2, from UFPR (Universidade Federal do Paraná, Brazil). It consists in a C program that converts `.ppm` image files in mosaics made with tiles consisting of flower images. It tries to match tile colors with the ones from the image, changing a piece from the image with a tile with approximately the same color.

You can find a complete description of the requirements, methods and expected results of this exercise in [prof. Carlos Maziero's page](http://wiki.inf.ufpr.br/maziero/doku.php) [here](http://wiki.inf.ufpr.br/maziero/doku.php?id=prog2:fotomosaico) (in Portuguese).
